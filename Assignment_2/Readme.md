Setup Instructions

For MacOS users:

Follow these steps below: 
python3 -m venv cnn-env
source cnn-env/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy opencv-python notebook
jupyter notebook
The you want to go into the directory and folder of where files are at then run file there.
Once inside Jupyter Notebook you will want to click "Run" then "Run all cells"
